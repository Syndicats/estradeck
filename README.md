# Estradeck

> ### An open-source presentation studio — from **[Syndicats](https://www.syndicats.de)**

**Estradeck** is a Slides-like web editor with [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) as foundation.
A deck is a single HTML file; Estradeck reads and writes that file **surgically** (byte-stable
per-slide edits) and previews it live. On top of the `revealjs` skill in `.claude/skills/revealjs/`
it adds reusable **themes**, an inline **AI assistant** + a parallel **agent fleet**, a **⌘K command
palette**, and one-click **PDF / MP4 export**.

> *Estradeck* = **estrade** (the stage a speaker stands on) + **deck** — where your deck takes the stage.
> Built by [Syndicats](https://www.syndicats.de). Not affiliated with or endorsed by reveal.js or Slides;
> "reveal.js" is used only to describe compatibility.

**Core idea — the file is the source of truth.** The server parses each deck with `parse5`
(`sourceCodeLocationInfo`) to get exact byte offsets, then applies edits by **string-splicing the
original bytes** and writing atomically (temp file + rename). Everything outside the edited slide
stays byte-identical. A `sha256` content hash guards against clobbering concurrent edits (returns
`409`, the editor shows a "reload" banner). A `chokidar` watcher broadcasts file changes over a
WebSocket so the preview and navigator stay in sync no matter who wrote the file — you, the inline
AI, or a fleet of headless agents.

---

## What it does

### Editing
- **Slide navigator** — every top-level `<section>` (and vertical child) listed; click to jump the
  live preview. Reorder by drag-and-drop, add / duplicate / delete slides. The navigator has three
  tabs: **Slides**, **Assets**, and **History**.
- **Live preview** — the real reveal.js deck in an iframe, auto-reloading on any change (your edits
  *and* the AI's), preserving your position. **Present** opens the deck full-screen in a new tab.
- **Per-slide code editor** — CodeMirror showing exactly the selected slide's source HTML; autosaves
  back to the file, with a conflict guard if the file changed underneath you. Format-on-demand
  (prettier).
- **Styles tab** — edit the deck's full `styles.css` directly, with the same hash-guarded atomic
  write.
- **Colors panel** — the deck's palette CSS variables from `styles.css` (`--primary-color`, …) as
  live swatches; edits are written back with comments/formatting preserved.
- **Theme tab** — see and switch the deck's applied theme and review the palette + fonts it inherits
  (see **[Themes](#themes)** below).
- **Animation panel** — per-slide transition / speed / auto-animate, background-color presets and a
  section-divider toggle, per-element **fragment** controls (`fade-up`, `rise`, `pop`, …), and
  deck-wide transition defaults.

### Themes
A **theme** is a reusable brand blueprint — a palette + fonts (and a set of standard slides) that any
deck can adopt. Themes are edited in their own **workspace** (the same three-pane layout as a deck);
you switch between decks and themes from the one dropdown in the top bar.

- **Apply a theme to a deck** — the theme's palette/fonts are *materialized* into the deck's
  `styles.css` (a managed `:root` block), so the deck stays a **self-contained**, publishable HTML
  file even if the theme later changes or is deleted. Deck-level overrides always win by cascade.
- **Theme slides** — reusable slide templates with `{{placeholder}}` tokens; each placeholder is
  **text**, **multiline**, or an **image** (a default from the theme's assets, overridable on insert).
  Theme slides get the full code editor too (highlighting, completion, Slides Intelligence, format),
  and you can step their fragment animations with the arrow keys in the preview.
- **Copy a deck slide → theme** — promote any polished slide into a theme, then add placeholders.
- **Insert a theme slide → deck** — pick a template, fill the placeholders in a dialog with a **live
  preview**, and it's spliced into the deck (referenced theme assets are copied across automatically).
  Or do it keyboard-only with **⌘I**.
- **Bundled `default` theme** — a clean, brand-neutral palette (blue/teal/slate, IBM Plex) matching
  the scaffold's out-of-the-box look. Make your own with **New theme** (optionally seeded from the
  current deck).

### AI assistance
- **Slides Intelligence (⌘K in the Code editor)** — an inline assistant in the Code tab. Select text
  (or none), press ⌘K, and describe a change in natural language; it rewrites the selection or recomposes the whole
  slide body. Runs on a **direct OpenAI call** for low latency, style-aware (it's fed the deck's CSS
  tokens, image list, and video list). Includes ghost-text autocomplete of your prompt as you type.
- **Agent fleet (⌘A)** — queue multiple headless **`claude` CLI** agents that work **asynchronously
  and in parallel**. Open the tab straight into a mode — **create a new slide**, **edit this slide**,
  or **generate multiple slides** — from the keyboard or the ⌘K palette. Up to
  `AGENT_CONCURRENCY` (3) run at once; the rest wait in the queue. Each agent runs in an isolated
  workspace and only writes one `slide.html`, which the server merges back into the deck — so
  concurrent agents on different slides never corrupt the file. Live transcript, status, and a
  cancel button per job; the navigator shows a pulsing dot on whichever slide an agent is editing.
- **Generate multiple slides** — give a topic and a count; a planner (OpenAI) decomposes it into an
  ordered, coherent outline, reserves the placeholder slides in order, then fans out one agent per
  slide so they fill in parallel without clashing.

### Assets
- **Images** — drag-and-drop / pick files, or pull from a URL, into the deck's `images/` folder;
  reference them as `images/NAME.png`.
- **Videos** — paste a YouTube (or other) URL and the server downloads it via **`yt-dlp`** (capped
  at 720p / 300 MB), generates a poster frame with **`ffmpeg`**, and adds a `.video-embed` style.
- **Import images from a website** — point the picker at any URL (from the ⌘K palette) and it lists
  every image on the page with a thumbnail + pixel size; multi-select and import them into the deck
  **or** a theme's assets. URLs without a scheme default to `https://`.

### Output
- **History** — every change snapshots the deck's previous bytes (last 60); restore any snapshot
  (the restore is itself undoable).
- **Export PDF** — render every slide to a pixel-perfect PDF via **decktape** + headless Chrome.
- **Export slide → MP4** — render a single slide *with its fragment animations* to a 1080p MP4
  (headless Chrome screencast + **ffmpeg**), with a per-step timeline editor.
- **Duplicate / delete deck.**
- **"Built with Estradeck" badge** — every generated deck carries a small bottom-right credit linking
  to the project (defined once in `base-styles.css`, so it ships inside the deck).

## Keyboard & command palette

Press **⌘K** (Ctrl+K) anywhere — including the Agents prompt — to open a fuzzy, GitHub-style
**command palette**. It searches every action and destination: switch deck/theme, jump to any slide
or inspector tab, present, export, **New deck** / **New theme**, **add slide from theme**, fetch an
image/video from a URL, or import images from a website. (Inside the Code editor, ⌘K stays bound to
Slides Intelligence.)

Direct shortcuts in deck mode:

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| **⌘K** | Open / close the command palette |
| **⌘I** | Add a slide from a theme (after the selected slide) |
| **⌘P** | Present — open the deck full-screen |
| **⌘E** | Export / download the deck as PDF |
| **⌘A** | Open the Agents tab |
| **↑ / ↓** | Previous / next slide in the navigator |

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Needed for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Node 20+** (developed on 22) + npm | everything | uses `process.loadEnvFile`, native `fetch` |
| Network access | the live preview | reveal.js / Font Awesome / Chart.js / ECharts load from CDN |
| **`claude` CLI**, installed and logged in | the **Agents** tab | the server inherits your shell's auth via `~/.claude` and stores no credentials. Override the binary with `CLAUDE_BIN=/path/to/claude` |
| **`OPENAI_API_KEY`** | **Slides Intelligence (⌘K)** + multi-slide planner | put it in `.env` (see below). The Agents tab does **not** need it |
| **Chrome / Chromium** | **Export PDF** and **Export slide → MP4** | auto-detected in the usual macOS/Linux locations; override with `CHROME_BIN` |
| **`ffmpeg`** | MP4 export + video poster frames | override with `FFMPEG_BIN` |
| **`yt-dlp`** | downloading videos from a URL | e.g. `brew install yt-dlp` |

Everything except the AI features and the export tools works with just Node + a browser.
The studio degrades gracefully — if a tool is missing you get a clear error only when you use the
feature that needs it.

---

## Getting started

```bash
npm install          # installs the root + client/server/shared workspaces
npm run dev          # starts the server (:5174) and client (:5173) together
```

Open **http://localhost:5173**, click **New deck**, and start editing.

> The agent fleet needs the `claude` CLI; the ⌘K assistant needs an OpenAI key in `.env`. Copy the
> template first if you want either: `cp .env.example .env` and fill in `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

Other scripts (from the repo root):

```bash
npm run typecheck    # tsc --noEmit across server + client
npm run build        # production build of the client (Vite → client/dist)
```

Run a workspace on its own if you prefer:

```bash
npm run dev:server   # tsx watch server/src/index.ts
npm run dev:client   # vite
```

---

## Configuration (`.env`)

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (gitignored) at the repo root; it's loaded at server startup, and
keys added later are picked up without a restart for the OpenAI features.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | — | Slides Intelligence (⌘K) + the multi-slide planner |
| `SI_MODEL` | `gpt-5.4-mini` | model for SI generation / planning |
| `SI_COMPLETE_MODEL` | `gpt-5.4-nano` | model for inline prompt autocomplete |
| `CLAUDE_BIN` | `claude` | path to the Claude CLI for the agent fleet |
| `PORT` | `5174` | server port |
| `CHROME_BIN` / `CHROME_PATH` | auto-detected | Chrome for PDF/MP4 export |
| `FFMPEG_BIN` | `ffmpeg` | ffmpeg for MP4 export & posters |

## How "New deck" works

`POST /api/decks` shells out to `.claude/skills/revealjs/scripts/create-presentation.js` with a
structure string like `1,1,d,1,1` (`1` = slide, `d` = section divider), writing `presentation.html`
+ a copy of the default `styles.css` into `presentations/<slug>/`. **New deck** also lets you set a
title and pick a **theme**, which is then materialized into the new deck's `styles.css`.

## How the agent fleet stays safe under concurrency

Each job runs in `.studio-work/<jobId>/` with a copy of the deck's `styles.css` and a read-only
`DECK_CONTEXT.html` for context. The agent is told to edit **only** `slide.html` (one `<section>`).
When it finishes, the server validates the result is a single section and merges it back via the
same byte-stable splice used everywhere else (`putSlide` for edits, `addSlide` for creates). Those
merges are synchronous read-modify-write operations, so even when several agents finish at once they
apply one at a time without interleaving — different slides never conflict, and the file is never
left half-written. Cancelling a job SIGTERMs its process and discards its workspace.

## Architecture at a glance

```
client/   React + Vite + TypeScript  (dev :5173, proxies /api /decks /ws → server)
server/   Node + Express + ws        (dev :5174)
shared/   shared TypeScript types
```

- **Client** — a zustand-backed SPA with two modes, **deck** and **theme**. The left
  **SlideNavigator** (slides / assets / history) and the right/bottom **Inspector**
  (Code · Styles · Colors · Theme · Animation · Agents) flank a live **Preview** iframe; theme mode
  swaps in the matching Theme\* panels. CodeMirror powers the editor, with the **SiDock** (⌘K in the
  Code tab) and the **CommandPalette** (⌘K elsewhere) layered on top.
- **Server** — the `deck/` module is the byte-stable engine (parse5 offsets + atomic splice).
  `decks/` holds the deck feature services (create, exports, images/videos, history,
  OpenAI intelligence); `themes/` is the parallel theme engine (palette materialization + slide
  templates). `agent/` runs the Claude fleet. `routes/` exposes them over REST; `ws.ts` pushes live
  updates.

### API surface (server)

REST under `/api`:
- Decks: `GET/POST /decks`, `GET/DELETE /decks/:id`, `POST /decks/:id/duplicate`,
  `GET/PATCH /decks/:id/config`, `GET /decks/:id/export.pdf`
- Slides: `GET/PUT/POST/DELETE /decks/:id/slides[/:key]`, `POST …/reorder`,
  `POST …/:key/duplicate`, `PATCH …/:key/section`, `GET …/:key/fragments`,
  `PATCH …/:key/fragment`, `POST …/:key/video`
- Styles: `GET/PUT /decks/:id/styles`, `GET/PUT /decks/:id/styles/raw`
- Images: `GET/POST /decks/:id/images`, `POST …/from-url`, `DELETE …/:name`
- Videos: `GET /decks/:id/videos`, `POST …/from-url`, `DELETE …/:name`
- History: `GET /decks/:id/history`, `POST …/:snapId/restore`
- Slides Intelligence: `POST /decks/:id/si`, `POST …/si/complete`
- Format: `POST /decks/:id/format`
- Agents: `GET/POST /decks/:id/agent`, `POST …/batch`, `POST …/:jobId/cancel`
- Themes: `GET/POST /themes`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /themes/:id`, `POST …/:id/sync-decks`;
  slides `GET/PUT/DELETE …/:id/slides/:slug`, `GET …/:id/slides/:slug/preview`,
  `POST …/:id/slides/from-deck`, `POST …/:id/si[/complete]`; assets `GET/POST/DELETE …/:id/assets`
- Deck ↔ theme: `GET/PUT /decks/:id/theme`, `POST …/theme/sync`, `POST …/theme/insert`
- Website images: `POST /scrape-images` · base component styles: `GET /brand/base.css`
- Static deck files for the iframe: `GET /decks/:id/*` (served `no-store`)

WebSocket (`/ws`, room-per-deck via `{type:'subscribe',deckId}`): `deck-changed`,
`jobs-snapshot`, `job-update`, `job-log`.

---

## Notes & limits

- Edit jobs target one slide each; two edit jobs on the *same* slide are last-writer-wins.
- Deleting/adding slides operates on top-level slides; vertical children are edited in place.
- New decks support single slides (`1`) and section dividers (`d`) only — not vertical stacks.
- The preview, the PDF/MP4 export, and a deck opened standalone all need network for the CDN assets.
- `presentations/` is treated as user data; uncomment the rule in `.gitignore` to keep decks local.
